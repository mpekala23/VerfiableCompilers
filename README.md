# Overview

This repository contains toy code implementing basic formalization results on a simple programming language.

## Reference

Code originally from a paper by Leo Okawa Ericson titled "Simple formally verified compiler in Lean" (https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1613286/FULLTEXT01.pdf). Slight modifications have been made, but the purpose of this repository and paper is mostly expository.
